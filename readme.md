# ASP.NET Core: From Zero to overkill

![logo](https://github.com/AspNetCoreFromZeroToOverkill/Home/blob/master/assets/aspnet-core-from-zero-to-overkill.jpg)

This is the home repository for the series of videos/posts I'll be making on ASP.NET Core and friends.

The goal of this series will be to build a complex application using ASP.NET Core, starting simple and complicating along the way.

The end result will probably be on the over-engineered side (hence the “overkill” on the title), because the application will be developed as an excuse to try a whole lot of technologies and concepts. If the application wasn’t being developed with educational purposes in mind, the outcome would certainly be simpler.
